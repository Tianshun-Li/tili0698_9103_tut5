Part 1
    Since our group has ultimately decided to use Monet's "Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule" for the major assignment, I am hoping to find some paintings with similar water surface ripples for inspiration.

    Firstly, the image I found is Monet's "Water Lilies." In this painting, Monet uses color blocks to express the reflection of light on the water surface, which can be replicated using Java.

    Next, I found Van Gogh's "Starry Night Over the Rhône," where he uses lines to depict the reflection of light on the water.

    In Monet's "Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule," there is a significant interaction between light and the water surface. I believe combining the techniques of color blocks and lines in the code will greatly benefit my major assessment.
