-Part 1

    Since our group has ultimately decided to use Monet's "Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule" for the major assignment, I am hoping to find some paintings with similar water surface ripples for inspiration.

    Firstly, the image I found is Monet's "Water Lilies." In this painting, Monet uses color blocks to express the reflection of light on the water surface, which can be replicated using Java.

    Next, I found Van Gogh's "Starry Night Over the Rhône," where he uses lines to depict the reflection of light on the water.

    In Monet's "Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule," there is a significant interaction between light and the water surface. I believe combining the techniques of color blocks and lines in the code will greatly benefit my major assessment.

    This technique uses randomly generated lines of different colors to form color blocks, which I believe is quite similar to the technique used in oil painting. At the same time, this dynamic formation of water surface ripples can make the entire image more impressionistic.
